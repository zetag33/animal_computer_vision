# Animal computer vision
Building multi-classification computer vision models on a 30.000 animal images dataset.

We are going to:

- Build a fully connected model.
- Build several cnn's with different combinations.
- InceptionV3, transfer learning.

The models range from a 40% accuracy for the fully connected model, to 98,63% accuracy for InceptionV3 fine tunned on the data.

We also cover data augmentation and fine-tuning.
